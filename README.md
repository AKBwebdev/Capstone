# Capstone Project
*Created as part of Udacity's Android Developer NanoDegree course by Google*

__________________

#### Project Goal

The project goal was to create an app using Android features learnt throughout the course. 


#### Project Overview

I created a simple **ToDo List App** as part of this project will allow keeping track of and managing everyday tasks, along with storing some additional information with each task (e.g. user will be able to pick a place from the Google Map if the task is destination related, scan a product barcode if the user likes an item but wants to buy it in the future, store an email, or store a phone number). 

#### Project Highlights
* Displays a list of tasks that can be sorted and filtered
* Allows user to add, edit, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed
* Allows user to add recurring tasks
* Allows user to include additional information with each task, e.g. product barcode, contact details, map location, etc.
* Allows setting a daily notification time to remind user of pending tasks
* Home screen widget displaying pending tasks.
